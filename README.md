Super Nintendo Build System for Sublime Text
===================================
Various scripts for building SNES ROMs from code editors. This is using the wla-65816 assembler and linker. 

Note that this only works with a single object (ie main.asm becomes main.o), and doesn't take into account .spc (sound) code. 

A(n old) demo of the Sublime Text version can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syg1kzBPyXU)
